    "using historical, behavioral and socio-economical information. This tool is of great benefit to \n",
    "subscription based companies allowing them to maximize the results of retention campaigns. The \n",
    "problem of churn predictive modeling has been widely studied by the data mining and machine learning\n",
    "communities. It is usually tackled by using classification algorithms in order to learn the \n",
    "different patterns of both the churners and non-churners. Nevertheless, current state-of-the-art \n",
    "classification algorithms are not well aligned with commercial goals, in the sense that, the models \n",
    "miss to include the real financial costs and benefits during the training and evaluation phases. In \n",
    "the case of churn, evaluating a model based on a traditional measure such as accuracy or predictive \n",
    "power, does not yield to the best results when measured by the actual financial cost, i.e., \n",

    "The two main objectives of subscription-based companies are to  acquire new subscribers and \n",

    "incrementing sales  while decreasing the number of churners. Furthermore, it is common knowledge \n",
    "that retaining a  customer is about five times less expensive than acquiring a new one , this creates  pressure to have better and more effective churn campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical churn campaign consists in identifying from the current customer base which ones are \n",
    "more likely to leave the company, and make an offer in order to avoid that behavior.\n",
    "With this in mind the companies use intelligence to create and improve retention and collection\n",
    "strategies. In the first case, this usually implies an offer that can be either a discount or a \n",
    "free upgrade during certain span of time. In both cases the company has to \tassume a cost for that \n",
